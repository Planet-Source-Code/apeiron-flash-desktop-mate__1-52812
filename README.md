### Description

Flash Desktop Mate can put a transparent flash animation that wanders around your desktop interacting with windows. It's a fun little program I made for my kids last Christmas, but you can pretty easily change to your own animations if you want. It shows window interaction, flash-vb communication, form drag, window on top etc. Must have windows 2000 or XP as it uses layered windows. '98 users can comment out two lines in form_load to try it without transparency, read the readme for more info. You also have to have a recent flash ocx 6 or 7 to run.
